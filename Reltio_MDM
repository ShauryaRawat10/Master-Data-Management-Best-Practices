Impact of Scattered Data structures on Customers and Organizations:
1. Customer Impact:
    > Inconsistent experience across website, mobile app, call center and in-store
    > Providing the same data repeatedly
    > Answering the same questions repeatedly
    > Changing data in one place but it is not updated elsewhere
    > Opting out repeatedly (Email Opt-Out)
    
2. Organizational Impact:
   > Simple Organization questions are difficult to answer
     1. How much business we do with company X?
     2. Who are our top 20 customers
     3. How many customers do we have in X industry?
     4. How many service tickets are open for company X right now?
     5. What product, services and contracts does company X own or use right now?
