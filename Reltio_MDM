Impact of Scattered Data structures on Customers and Organizations:
1. Customer Impact:
    > Inconsistent experience across website, mobile app, call center and in-store
    > Providing the same data repeatedly
    > Answering the same questions repeatedly
    > Changing data in one place but it is not updated elsewhere
    > Opting out repeatedly (Email Opt-Out)
    
2. Organizational Impact:
   > Simple Organization questions are difficult to answer
     1. How much business we do with company X?
     2. Who are our top 20 customers
     3. How many customers do we have in X industry?
     4. How many service tickets are open for company X right now?
     5. What product, services and contracts does company X own or use right now?

                                      -> Organizations         //                                                                // Fits neatly in fields or columns

                              Things                           // A subset of master data. Any data in drop down lists           //

 Data Quality Challenges:
1. Poor Data Quality Sources:
   > Incorrect information entered in apps
   > Overloaded attributes
   > Forcing required information to be entered
   > Default values in apps
   > System limitation such as character limit
   > Integration processes manipulating data to fit into the target system
   > Lack of visibility in app about data that exists elewhere in the organization
   
2. Data Duplication:
   > Each app is its own data silo
   > Only care about its own information and executing business processes 
   > Same customer may appear multiple times
   > The application may not identify multiple records
   > Companies do not know - Who someone is, All their relationship and how they are interacting or transacting
   
3. Data Inconsistency
   > Inconsistent reference data appears in the drop down list. Refernce data is application specific.
   > Hidden code values are key in the database. eg US, USA, 100, 01, United States could mean same country in each database
   > Difficult to pull data from all system with different code and combine them
   
4. Poor Data Quality Impacts
   > Gartner reports poor data quality costs businesses an average of $13.1 million each year
   > IBM estimates $3 trillion costs on aggregate in US alone
   > 94% of organizations suspect that their customer and prospect data may be inaccurate
   > Duplication rates between 10-30% are not uncomman
