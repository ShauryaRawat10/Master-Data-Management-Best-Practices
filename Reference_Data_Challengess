Refrence Data Management is a Challenge as various Source Systems come with their own representation of Data.
This Data need to be Transcoded or Standardized into Single Trusted Value in the Reltio MDM Central Repository.
From Users Perspective, it will be ListOfValues which are Standardized and Can be selected from UI.

1. List Of Values Standardization :
   
   Gender      :   M <=> Male <=> M. <=> ML
   Specialty   :   General Practice <=> General Practitoner <=> Practitioner
   Prefix      :   Mr. <=> Mr <=> M. 
   State       :   Uttarancal <=> Uttarakhand <=> UK
   VisitOptOut :   1 <=> True <=> Yes
   
   Data Standardization is required in MDM to make a Trusted Golden records having only one representation of reference data which can be used by Downstream 
   and UpStream.
   
   The Source System Must send a "Source_Code" along with "Source_Value" to understand the Code and map it correctly to Canonical Code and Value.
   
   SourceSystem |  Attribute  |  Source_Code | Source_Value  | Canonical_Code | Canonical_Value
   Veeva           Gender        M             Male            GEN.M            Male
   Onekey          Gender        M.            Male            GEN.M            Male
   GCP             State         101           Uttarancal      ST.23            Uttarakhand
   GRV             State         78            Uttarakhand     ST.23            Uttarakhand


 2. Dependent Lookups :
    
    There must be dependency on Lookups which will help Data Stewards user for selection of Correct LOV.
    
    For eg : When Country = :"FR" is Selected it must show States of France Country only.
    
    * Dependent Lookups are configured in Reltio L3 Configuration. 
    * Customer has 50-60 LOV attributes to be Standardized including Gender, State, BrickType, BrickValue, IdentifierType, Specialty, COTSpecialty, Disclosure, etc
      which must all be included under DependentLookups section oif Country in L3 Configuration to segment the data.
