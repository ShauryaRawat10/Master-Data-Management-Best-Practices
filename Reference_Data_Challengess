Refrence Data Management is a Challenge as various Source Systems come with their own representation of Data.
This Data need to be Transcoded or Standardized into Single Trusted Value in the Reltio MDM Central Repository.
From Users Perspective, it will be ListOfValues which are Standardized and Can be selected from UI.

1. List Of Values Standardization :
   
   Gender      :   M <=> Male <=> M. <=> ML
   Specialty   :   General Practice <=> General Practitoner <=> Practitioner
   Prefix      :   Mr. <=> Mr <=> M. 
   State       :   Uttarancal <=> Uttarakhand <=> UK
   VisitOptOut :   1 <=> True <=> Yes
   
   Data Standardization is required in MDM to make a Trusted Golden records having only one representation of reference data which can be used by Downstream 
   and UpStream.
   
   The Source System Must send a "Source_Code" along with "Source_Value" to understand the Code and map it correctly to Canonical Code and Value.
   
   SourceSystem |  Attribute  |  Source_Code | Source_Value  | Canonical_Code | Canonical_Value
   Veeva           Gender        M             Male            GEN.M            Male
   Onekey          Gender        M.            Male            GEN.M            Male
   GCP             State         101           Uttarancal      ST.23            Uttarakhand
   GRV             State         78            Uttarakhand     ST.23            Uttarakhand
