=> Rationalized : In general, "rationalized" means to bring order or structure to something, often by removing inconsistencies or inefficiencies.
                  In the context of data management and Master Data Management (MDM), rationalization refers to the process of standardizing and 
                  consolidating data from disparate sources into a single, unified view. 
                  This includes removing duplicates, identifying and resolving conflicts or inconsistencies, and aligning data with business rules and policies.
                  The result is a more accurate, complete, and reliable view of the data, which can be used to improve business operations, analytics, 
                  and decision-making.
                  In summary, rationalization in the context of data management means organizing & optimizing data to create a more efficient & accurate view of it
