Match Level Cleansers:
 > Are completely different set of cleansers from profile level cleansers
 > Are dedicated to and invoked exclusively by match engine
 > Do not insert a crosswalk and do not modify the data in the entity
 > Fetch the data from attributes and transform the data in-memory only for matching purpose
 > Operate before Tokenization and before comparison process
 > Provides 3 basic cleansing operation:
   - Synonym Matching (Name Dictionary Cleanser)
   - String Replacement
   - Noise Words Removal

Name Dictionary Cleanser:
 > Mostly used to explicitly match synonym first name where the structure and pronunciation are so distinct that phonetic and other fuzzy approaches may not match them
 > Eg: Alexandria and Alix
 > Name Dictionary is based on simple excel file
 > Each row declares a base name and its synonyms (Alexandria, Alix, Lexi, Ali)
 > Match Engine treats all rows declared in the excel row as semantically equal
 > Instantiated as Cleanse Adapter within the match configuration
