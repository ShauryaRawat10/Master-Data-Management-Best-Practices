Reference Data Management using RDM:
 > Adding the lookup to your L3:
   {
     "hidden" : "false",
     "uri" : "configuration/entityTypes/contact/attributes/status",
     "lookupCode" : "rdm/lookupTypes/Status"
   }
 > Specifying the Source in L3 and RDM Configuration
 > 

Creating Hierarchical LookupTypes:
 > Lookups can be organized into hierarchy where values in one attribute depends on values in second attribute
 > State depends on the selection of country
 > Add dependentLookupAttributes in country attribute of L3

Localizing Canonical Values:
 > Canonical Value is displayed in selected language
 > Canonical value in the respective language is provided by customer only
 > Attributes and UI is localized automatically once browser's default language is updated

Creating and Using Custom attributes:
 > A LookupType can have custom attribute associated with it. 
 > Country could have custom attribute as Population and Currency to provide extra information about selected country
   Custom attributes are only available via RDM API, they can not be displayed in UI
   However, Get entity will return the json with Custom attributes also
   {
     "type" : "configuration/entityTypes/contact/attributes/Country",
     "ov" : true,
     "value" : "Unites States",
     "lookupCode" : "US"
     "lookupRawValue" : "Unites States",
     "lookupAttributes" : [
        "name" : "population",
        "value" : "768000000"
      ],
      "uri" : "configuration/entityTypes/contact/attributes/Country/1rjdjbd",
   }


Activity Log:
 > Captures details of changes made to each of the following RDM Component
   - Lookup Types
   - Sources
   - Lookup Value
 > Activity Log contains detail of the following event:
   - Created, updated, deleted lookup Types, sources and lookups
   - Created, updated, deleted custom attributes


Generators:
 > RDM generator can be used to automatically generate lookup values code
 > If you have large number of values to load for a lookup using the API and do not have simple way to 
   create unique canonical codes
 > Codes will be displayed in the UI dropdown because they will be differnt from Canonical Values
 > 2 steps to enable this feature:
   - Define the generator (UUID - Universal unique id, Sequential - incremented by one)
   - Specify that generator should be used for canonical codes
 > Select Auto Generate Canonical Code in Lookup Types specified earlier

Managing Unmapped Values:
 > If an attribute has lookup and new value is created which is not in existing lookup list, it will be flagged as Unmapped value
 > We need to map such values to existing or new canonical code
 > To enable unmapped values tracking in all MDM tenant subscibed to RDM tenant, use trackTranscodeErrors to True in RDM Configuration
 > To enable unmapped values tracking only one MDM tenant subscibed to RDM tenant, use publishMDMErrors to True in Physical Configuration

Exporting Lookup Details:
 > Lookup Details can be exported to csv or json file using RDM UI
 > Following can be exported:
   - Lookup Types
   - Sources and Values
   - Custom Attributes
   - Translations
   - Hierarchies
   - Audit Data
 > Email will be sent to user id with link to exported data
