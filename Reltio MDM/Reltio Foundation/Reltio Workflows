Overview
 > In Reltio platform, the workflows feature allows you to manage business processes through a series of predetermined steps
   or tasks based on predefined rules or conditions
 > Reltio has predefined out-of-the-box workflows to handle typical business use case and automate the implementation process

Why workflows?
 > Data Governance is often described as People, process, and technology coming together to improve the quality of enterprice data
 > Some key challenges that business face when enriching and managing data can be broadly classified into:
   1. Non-Standardized business process
   2. Miscommunication
   3. Lack of accountability
   4. Difficult tracking
 > Business need a way to reduce the noise and provide users only the relevant information that they need for decision making
   This information can be either system generated or provided by collaborators
 > Businesses look for mechanism to assign tasks to the most appropriate person available at a given time to help increase
   the overall throughput and minimize error and cost
 > A robust tracking mechanism helps businesses implement the business process and drive overall accountability

 > Actors in Reltio Workflow:
   A typical workflow used to implement a repeatable business process with clearly defined accountability. Users with different
   role interact with workflows and tasks in a different ways.
   1. Business Users : Initiate workflow
   2. Data Stewards : Resolve workflow tasks
   3. System Administrators : Manage users, roles, and tasks
   4. Business Analysts, developers : Modify Out-of-the-box workflows or develop custom workflows

 > Only users with role ROLE_WORKFLOW can initiate a workflow

What are workflows?
 > Workflow represent an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of activity. A workflow consists of a sequence of tasks that
   achieve a specific business goal
 > Example: Workflow to verify a personal details and lists the various tasks involved in personal details verification
            process flow
            Import Contacts > Verify Addresses > Verify Email > Verify Phone > Accept record

Workflow Tasks:
 > An individual step in workflow is called a task
 > Workflow tasks can be broadly classified into 2 major categories:
   1. User tasks : 
      > Tasks that can be manually carried out by user
      > Perfomed by Users such as review and approval
   2. System tasks : 
      > Tasks that are triggered and performed by the system when specific conditions are met
      > Performed by system such as listening to events, triggering appropriate actions, validating user input and context,
        notifying users based on predefined configuration
 > In Reltio you can:
   1. Create tasks 
   2. Claim and complete a task
   3. Control and update the assignee for a task
   4. Collaborate with other users by commenting on a task

Potential Match Review Workflow:

 Start  >   Match Review  >  Decision Gateway   --Merge-->    Merge Service     >    End 
                                    |                                                  |
                                    |------Not-a-Match--->  Not a Match Service -------|

 Match Review: It is a user task and requires user intervention
 Merge and Not a Match Services: System tasks that are triggered and automatically managed by system based on user action
 Reltio workflow is not enabled by default. Customers need to request workflow to be enabled.
