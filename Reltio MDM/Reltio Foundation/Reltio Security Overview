Reltio Platform Security Model:

  The Reltio Cloud Platform is cloud native and leverages security regimes from world leading public cloud providers 
  (i.e. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure), as well as Reltio’s own internal data security practices, to deliver Reltio services 
  to our customers.

1. Access
  The Reltio platform's security model provides granular access across all services to users based on the least-privileged access principle. 
  This means, users can only access those resources and data that they need to perform their job roles based on specific business requirements. 
  The idea is to ensure the right people have access to the right resources. 
  
2. Role-Based Access Controls
  Customers are responsible for defining and managing users, roles, and groups, within the customer’s deployment based on their business requirement . 
  Customers can administer role-based access control (RBAC) using the Reltio Console or Reltio APIs.  
  Authorization is denied by default, and only users who have explicit access permissions to a Reltio resource may perform functions in the Reltio Cloud Platform.  

3. Metadata security 
   It helps you bridge this gap. Metadata security allows you to restrict user access to specific types of metadata at the entity, relationship, 
   or attribute-level based on their role. By implementing Metadata security, you will have better granular control over your user access. 

4. Single Sign-On
  The platform supports Single Sign-On (SSO) access for customers with both SAML and OIDC protocols, and also provides role-based access 
  controls for customers to maintain access rights to its tenants.  
  
5. Administrative Access
  Reltio support and administrative access to customer production systems is restricted.  
  Customers can request administrative access for their staff based on a valid business need such as a bugfix by submitting a Support ticket.
