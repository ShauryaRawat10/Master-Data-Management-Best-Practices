> Synchronous vs Asynchronous 
  Synchronous:
  - For this API call, data is processed at the time of the request. Any requested data is returned in the API call response.
  - Synchronous process run in series and are generally used for small amounts of data or simple processing tasks

  Asynchronous:
  - Asynchronous API call add a processing task as a batch job to a processing queue. The API response returns information about the job.
  - Batch jobs run in parallel with several processors working simultaneously. So, large jobs gets split up and processed efficiently.
    You can monitor the status of the jobs using the APIs
  - Asynchronous processes are generally used for large amounts of data or complex processing tasks.

> Javasript Object Notation (JSON)
  - Data and Metadata stored in Reltio tenants are stored as JSON Objects
  - It includes Entities, Relationships, interactions. The definition of data models(types), cleansers, match rules, survivoship rules are stored as JSON

> Application Program Interface (API)
  - Reltio uses Application Program Interface (API) first software development strategy.
  - Everything we need to do when interacting with Reltio tenant can be done using secure REST API. 
  - Reltio UI also used API to fetch data. All integration methods use API either explicitly or in background

> Loading data into Reltio with APIs

  - Asynchronous Load API
    It is the most efficient way to process data load. The way can be to bulk load data from files, which will start batch job.
    - Upload files from S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storgae, SFTP
    - Limits CSV (33 GB max remote, 50 MB max local), Excel (100,000 rows, 50 MB max local), JSON (50 MB max, 30-50 records at a time)
    - Best for Bulk loads, historical data loads, batched updates, loading one type at a time, easy mapping

   - Synchronous LOad API
     Most flexible way to load data into Reltio. Best way to load data for continuous system integrations.
     - This API is typically how the pre-built Reltio Connectors and Integration HUB (RIH) load data.
     - It triggers immediate processing
     - Data is loaded at run time. API response contains information about success and failure of the load.
     - Two basic steps to load data:
       > TRansform data into Reltio specific JSON 
       > Use the appropriate API to load the data
     - Post data using crossswalk id, entity id, relationship id, relationship start and end entity id
     - Can post entities and relationships at the same time
     - Best for Single record uploads, Small batch of updates, loading interactions, transformed data, continuous integration
