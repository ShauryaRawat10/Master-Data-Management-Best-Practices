Data Tenant Subscription Service (DTSS)
 > Sharing of data from a single "Data Tenant" with multiple "Customer Tenants"
 > Seamless sharing of data between any number of Reltio tenants, without any external ETL or integartion effort
 > Access to 3rd party data provider content (such as NPI, DEA, etc) from selected best of breed data partners (either
   via a prebuilt and integrated connector or full load of reference data from external provider)

DTSS consist of:
 > Data Tenant : Source of data to be shared
 > One or more Customer Tenant : CT are recipients of data from data tenant
 > Event Queue : When data is created, updated and deleted in DT, an event is published onto queue with the ID and event
   type of the record that triggered event in DT
 > DTSS Application Service : Monitors the event queue and processes the events as they are received according to business
   rules configured in DTSS subscription
 > DTSS Subscription : Specifies how data in the Data Tenant will be used to match and update the data in a Customer Tenant.
   Each Customer tenant has its own subscription

Data Tenant:
 > DT contains 3rd party data that can be used to enhance a customer's own data
 > DT are maintained by Reltio, access to them can be licensed from Reltio or 3rd party data provider
 > DT can be subscribed to by one or more Customer Tenants
 > Customer tenant can also subscribe to one or more DT
 > Custom Data Tenants can be created for Reltio Customers and Partners
 
DTSS Event Queue:
 > When any change occurs in DT, an event is published on internal queue with ID of the record that created the event and 
   the event type
 > This queue is monitored by DTSS application service which evaluates each event and takes action in accordance with business
   rules defined in application service.

DTSS Application Service:
 > The event queue is monitored by DTSS application service which evaluates each event and takes action in acccordance
   with the business rules defined in application service
 > When a customer licenses a DTSS service, Reltio will create an initial subscription between DT and CT depending on
   which DTSS service has been licensed. A variety of operations, monitoring and administrative functions are available
   to customers via the application service API.
