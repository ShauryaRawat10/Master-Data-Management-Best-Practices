Matching and Merging of Data from Syndicated Source Systems comes with many Challenges:

1. MultiLingual Data of Same Customer:
   - Schroeter <=> Schröter
   - B. Mueller <=> Bodo Müllér
   
   * Problem Can be solved using Reltio MDM Physical Configuration Settings. 
     StripDiacritic = True (It will Strip all the diacritic Characters and solve the problem of Exact Matching of Data)
   
   * Transliterator Cleanser 
     Reltio Provides Transliterator Cleanser which will match latin and non-latin data. The Cleanser is Match Rule Level Cleanser.

   2. Change in Surname (After Marriage or Legally Changing Name)
      
      - Myra Waters <=> Myra Georg

   3. Diffrence in Representation across sources:
      
      ADDRESSLINE1 :  PUJOL SURI#ACH MARTI            <=> MARTI PUJOL SURINYACH
                      PZ DE LAS HERRERIAS, S/N        <=> PLAZA DE LAS HERRERIAS SN
                      AVDA MOSSEN PONS I RABADAM SN   <=> AV.MOSSEN PONS I RABADAM S/N
                      AV SIERRA DE ATAPUERCA 4        <=> Pº SIERRA DE ATAPUERCA, 4
      HospitalsName : B-CENTRO COOP.FTCO.TALAVERANO   <=> CENTRO COOP FCO TALAVERANO SC
                      CTRO SALUD PUBLICA DE DENIA     <=> CENTRO DE SALUD PUBLICA DENIA
                      SAVALL PEREZ, M.JESUS           <=> SAVALL PEREZ MARIA JESUS
                      DE MARIANO CB                   <=> FARMACIA DE MARIANO
                      
      * To Some extend the problem can be solved using NoiseDictionary which will eliminate the Noise words while matching.
        For eg : NoiseDictionary having words like "Farmacia", "Plaza", "S/N", "SN"
        Noise Dictionary has to be separate for Addresses and Names.
        
      * Reltio MDM Match Rules Comparator and Token Classes 
        Using Fuzzy Clause and adding the DistinctWordsComparator and DistinctWordsMatchToken 
        This comparator will compare Words and Characters based on the Thresholds (Threshold, ThresholdChars)
        If Threshold = 50%, It will try to Match 50% words from Different Soure System.
        
        DistinctWordsComparator However, will create huge no of Match Tokens impacting the Performance of the Tenant.
        
    4. Matching of Full Names with Nick Names/ similar Names
       
       First Name   :  Micki  <=>     Michaela 
       
       * Reltio MDM Fuzzy Operator can match these Names based on Default Comparator or Soundex Compator.
        
    4. Data Quality Issue
       ADDRESSLINE1 :  PUJOL SURI#ACH MARTI            <=> MARTI PUJOL SURINYACH
       
       * Reltio MDM Provides StringFunctionCleanser which works at the Profile Level and correct the Data from Source System.
         Srub : "!~*.,%()"   (It will Scrub all the unwanted characters)
         
         Not Recommended as this Cleanser works at Profile Level and create a New SourceSystem for the corresponsing cleansed data.
         
       * Correcting it in Source System itself or in ETL logic before FullLoad / PartialLoad / PatchLoad
       
    5. Completely Different Address and Names:
       Using Identifiers from Trusted sources and Matching based on Identifier (ID Based Rule).
